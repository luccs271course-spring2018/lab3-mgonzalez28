* Also try with a LinkedList - does it make any difference?
  - Using a LinkedList makes no difference. All tests pass successfully.

* What happens if you use *list.remove(77)*?

# TestList
* Also try with a LinkedList - does it make any difference?
  - Using a LinkedList makes no difference. All test pass successfully.

* *list.remove(Integer.valueOf(5))* - what does this one do?
